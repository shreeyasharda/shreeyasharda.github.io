Thanks for visiting my website! I created this site to give future employers, advisors, and other collaborators a snapshot of my technical and soft skills!! 


Who I am
======
I am currently a Master's student at The George Washington University, studying Computer Science. I am part of the Joint BA & MS in Computer Science (CS) program at GW. I took an interdisciplinary approach to my undergrad education by tailoring my undergrad degree to blend coursework in Business and Sustainability in addition to CS. As I pursued my coursework at GW, I simultaneously acquired 4+ years of professional experience in AI/ML: from academic research to startups to defense consulting. Along the way, I  engaged in independent projects focused around NLP and a master's thesis focused around state of the art NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Gemini). Through this way, I became skilled in a technical (machine learning, data science, product management) and non-technical way (leadership, team collaboration, interpersonal communication), preparing me well for future opportunities. Using this foundation, my short term goal is to pursue a PhD in CS after my Masters ( I will apply for the program in Fall 2026, upon completion of my Masters). My long term goal is to become a Professor and mentor young minds!

I am currently looking for data science internships for Summer 2026 and I would love to collaborate to learn more. 

core skills: data visualization (using Tableau, matplotlib, seaborn), data science/machine learning (using scikit-learn, tensorFlow, openCV, pyTorch, textBlob, SQL), python programming
