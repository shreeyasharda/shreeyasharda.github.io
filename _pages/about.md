Thanks for visiting my website! My goal is to give future employers, advisors, and other collaborators a snapshot of my technical and soft skills!! 


About Me
======
I am currently a Master's student at The George Washington University, studying Computer Science. I am part of the Joint BA & MS in Computer Science (CS) program at GW. I took an interdisciplinary approach to my undergrad education by tailoring my undergrad degree to blend coursework in Business and Sustainability in addition to CS. As I pursued my coursework at GW, I simultaneously acquired 4+ years of professional experience in AI/ML: moving from academic research to startups to defense consulting. Along the way, I  engaged in independent projects focused around NLP (emedding, tokenization, LLMs). These experiences have led me to my master's thesis in which I am studying the relationship between types of datasets (synthetic and original) and model archiectures (rule-based, neural networks, machine learning). I am evaluating this relationship by seeing how state of the art NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Gemini) perform on common ML metrics (F1, precision, recall, cross-validation). I seek to understand why the models are failing in prescribing sentiment to certain online reviews, finding patterns in the language of the reviews.  Through this way, I became skilled in a technical (machine learning, data science, product management) and non-technical domain (leadership, team collaboration, interpersonal communication), preparing me well for future opportunities. 

Goals
======
Using this foundation, my short term goal is to find a data science intership for Summer 2026 and pursue a PhD in CS in Fall 2026 ( I will apply for the PhD in Fall 2026, upon completion of my Masters). My long term goal is to become a Professor and mentor young minds! 

Research Interests 
======

**Broad Areas**
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Machine Learning (ML)
3. Computer Vision (CV) (object detection and image classification tasks) 
4. Human Robotic Interaction (HRI)

**Specific Areas**
1. Casual Inference
2. AI Governance (e.g., Fairness, Bias, AI Risk Management, NIST, CHAI, Responsible AI)

I am also passionate about taking an interdisciplinary approach to my research by leveraging tools such as cognitive psychology to improve model documentation for ML models. I am also interested in applying my work to healthcare. 


Technical Skills
======
1. data visualization using Python (matplotlib, seaborn) and Tableau 
2. data science/machine learning using Python ( scikit-learn, tensorFlow, openCV, pyTorch) and SQL
3. NLP using Python (textBlob, NLTK, spacy, GloVe, word2vec)
