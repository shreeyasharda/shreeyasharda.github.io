Thanks for visiting my website! My goal is to give future employers, advisors, and other collaborators a snapshot of my technical and soft skills!! 


About Me
======
I am currently a Master's student at The George Washington University, studying Computer Science. I am part of the Joint BA & MS in Computer Science (CS) program at GW. I took an interdisciplinary approach to my undergrad education by tailoring my undergrad degree to blend coursework in Business and Sustainability in addition to CS. As I pursued my coursework at GW, I simultaneously acquired 4+ years of professional experience in AI/ML: from academic research to startups to defense consulting. Along the way, I  engaged in independent projects focused around NLP. This has brought me to my master's thesis in which I am studying the relationship between types of datasets (synthetic and original) state of the art NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Gemini). Through this way, I became skilled in a technical (machine learning, data science, product management) and non-technical domain (leadership, team collaboration, interpersonal communication), preparing me well for future opportunities. 

Goals
======
Using this foundation, my short term goal is to find a data science intership for Summer 2026 pursue a PhD in CS in Fall 2026 ( I will apply for the PhD in Fall 2026, upon completion of my Masters). My long term goal is to become a Professor and mentor young minds! 

Research Interests 
======

**Broad Areas**
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Machine Learning (ML)
3. Computer Vision (CV) (object detection and image classification tasks) 
4. Human Robotic Interaction (HRI)
5. Interdisciplinary approach (leverage cognitive psychology to study the above research topics)

**Specific Areas**
1. Casual Inference
2. AI Governance (e.g., Fairness, Bias, AI Risk Management, NIST, CHAI, Responsible AI)
   

Technical Skills
======
core skills: data visualization (using Tableau, matplotlib, seaborn), data science/machine learning (using scikit-learn, tensorFlow, openCV, pyTorch, textBlob, SQL), python programming
