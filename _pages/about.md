My goal is to give future employers, advisors, and other collaborators a snapshot of my technical and soft skills.


About Me
======
I am currently a Master's student at The George Washington University, studying Computer Science. I am part of the Joint BA & MS in Computer Science (CS) program at GW. I took an interdisciplinary approach to my undergrad education by tailoring my undergrad degree to blend coursework in Business and Sustainability in addition to CS. As I pursued my coursework at GW, I simultaneously acquired 4+ years of professional experience in AI/ML: moving from academic research to startups to defense consulting. Along the way, I engaged in independent projects focused around NLP (emedding, tokenization, LLMs). These experiences have led me to my master's thesis in which I am studying the relationship between types of datasets (synthetic and original) and model architectures (rule-based, deep learning, machine learning). I am evaluating this relationship by comparing the performance of state of the art NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Gemini) on sentiment analysis tasks, using common ML metrics (F1, precision, recall, cross-validation). I seek to understand why the models are failing in prescribing sentiment to certain online reviews, finding patterns in the language of the reviews.  Through this way, I have become skilled in a technical (machine learning, data science, deep learning) and non-technical domain (leadership, team collaboration, interpersonal communication), preparing me well for future opportunities. 

Goals
======
Using this foundation, my short term goal is to pursue a PhD in CS in Fall 2026. My long term goal is to become a Professor and mentor young minds! I want to dedicate my life to conducting high-impact research and traveling around the world to give talks. 

Research Interests 
======

**Broad Areas**
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Machine Learning (ML)
3. Deep Learning (DL)
4. Computer Vision (CV) (object detection and image classification tasks) 
5. Human Robotic Interaction (HRI)

**Specific Areas**
1. Casual Inference
2. AI Governance (e.g., Fairness, Bias, AI Risk Management, NIST, CHAI, Responsible AI)

I am also passionate about taking an interdisciplinary approach to my research by leveraging tools such as cognitive psychology to improve model documentation for ML models. I am also interested in applying my work to healthcare. 


Technical Skills
======
1. data visualization using Python (matplotlib, seaborn) and Tableau 
2. data science/machine learning using Python ( scikit learn, tensorFlow, openCV, pyTorch, XGBoost) and SQL
3. NLP using Python (textBlob, NLTK, spacy, GloVe, word2vec)
4. design, build, deploy, and improve machine learning & statistical models to analyze structured and unstructured datasets
5. train, validate, and optimize models using large datasets
6. technical writing for scholarly publications
7. GPUs

Soft Skills (Strengths vs Weaknesses)
======
**Strengths**
1. Curious (I am always looking to advance my knolwedge using textbooks, peer reviewed articles, blog posts; I have compiled my research into a giant respository, going from fundamentals to advanced topics. I use this work to help me identify research gaps for my PhD, decipher journal articles, keep track of emerging trends in fields such as NLP).
2. Transparent (I am a big advocate for transparent ML/DL systems to help advance the trustworthy AI initiative. To that end, I try to be transparent about my own life. That is why I included the weaknesses portion on my website.)

**Weaknesses** 
1. Taking on too much with too little time (I am ambitious so that trait is sort of a double edged sword! With that being said, I have made a concious effort of understanding how long it takes to produce high quality work, from me. I use that to guide what I can realistically take on vs put off for later).
